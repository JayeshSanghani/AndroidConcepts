🧩 How to Drastically Reduce Your Android App Size (Even in Large-Scale Projects)
When you’re building large-scale Android apps, app size often grows unchecked — dragging down performance, install rates, and user experience. But size is not just a byproduct of features — it’s a result of how you architect your app. In this post, we’ll explore a set of practical, production-proven strategies that go beyond surface-level tricks. Whether you’re maintaining a feature-heavy app or scaling fast, these architectural decisions will help you deliver a leaner, faster, and more modular Android app.

✅ 1. Switch to Android App Bundle (AAB)
Google Play recommends .aab over .apk. Why?
Only delivers code/resources specific to user’s device.
Results in up to 30–50% smaller downloads.
Supports dynamic feature delivery (on-demand modules).

./gradlew bundleRelease


🖼️ 2. Optimize Resources
Your resources folder is often a hidden source of bloat.
🔍 Remove unused resources: Use Android Studio’s Lint or plugins like android-unused-resources.
📐 Use vector drawables instead of raster images.
📦 Convert images to .webp (lossless compression, smaller size).
🌐 Limit locales and screen densities:
defaultConfig {
    resConfigs "en", "xxhdpi"
}


✂️ 3. Enable Code and Resource Shrinking (R8)
Use R8 to shrink, obfuscate, and optimize code. This also removes unused methods and resources.
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
Don’t forget to test thoroughly — aggressive shrinking may remove critical code if rules aren’t set properly.

🧱 4. Modularize Using Dynamic Feature Modules
Break your app into modules (e.g., chat, payments, AR).
Reduce initial download size.
Load features on demand via Play Feature Delivery.
Example use case: Load a PDF viewer only when user opens a report.

📦 5. Audit and Prune Dependencies
Third-party libraries can silently increase size.
Use ./gradlew app:dependencies to inspect.
Avoid libraries that do too much (e.g., guava, play-services full suite).
Exclude unnecessary transitive dependencies:
implementation("library") {
    exclude group: 'com.example.unwanted', module: 'bigmodule'
}

📉 6. Split by ABI or Density (if using APKs)
For APK builds, reduce size by targeting only needed ABIs:
splits {
    abi {
        enable true
        include "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a"
        universalApk false
    }
}
Each user gets a minimal APK tailored to their device.

☁️ 7. Offload Heavy Assets to Server
Large assets like fonts, PDFs, videos, or models? Don’t ship them with the app.
Host on a secure backend or CDN.
Download and cache them at runtime.

🔍 8. Analyze Final Build Size
Use Android Studio > Analyze APK to drill down into what’s taking up space:
classes.dex – bloated with unused methods?
res/ – old icons or duplicate images?
assets/ – unnecessary media files?
This will help you identify and eliminate culprits quickly.

💡 Bonus Tips
Use lazy loading to avoid bundling everything at startup.
Avoid excessive use of reflection — it hampers R8 optimization.
Prefer Kotlin’s stdlib and features over large Java utilities.

🚀 Final Thoughts
Optimizing for app size isn’t just a release-time concern — it’s a mindset that starts with how you design your modules, manage dependencies, and deliver features. By applying these architectural principles early and consistently, you not only reduce download size but also gain better performance, maintainability, and scalability. Stay lean, stay modular, and always build with the end-user experience in mind.
