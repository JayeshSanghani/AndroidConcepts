-->	Constructor in kotlin
--What is a Constructor in Kotlin?
	Constructor is a special function used to initialize an object. Kotlin provides two types of constructors:
	1)Primary Constructor: Declared in the class header and is concise.
	2)Secondary Constructor: Defined inside the class body and provides more flexibility.

--Why Use Constructors?
	To initialize object properties when the object is created.
	To enforce constraints or validations during object creation.
	To provide multiple ways of creating objects with different initial states.

--When to Use Constructors?
	Primary Constructor: Use when the class requires straightforward initialization with a fixed set of properties.
	Secondary Constructor: Use when additional initialization logic is needed or when you need to handle multiple
	ways of creating an object (overloaded constructors).
