-->Flow
Flow is asynchronous data stream that emits values to the collector and get completed with or without exception.


-->Flow vs State flow vs Shared flow
Feature						Flow										State flow									Shared flow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type					Cold stream										Hot stream									Hot stream
Behavior				Emits values only when collected.				Holds the latest emitted value.				Can emit multiple values to multiple collectors.
Replay Behavior			No replay. New collectors receive nothing.		Always has an initial/default value.		Can be configured to replay past values.
State Retention			No state retention.								Retains the last emitted value.				Can be configured to retain values.
Multiple Collectors		Each collector gets a new stream.				All collectors receive the latest value.	All collectors share the same stream.
Use Case				One-time data fetch, network calls.				UI state management (like LiveData).		Event-based scenarios (e.g., UI events, notifications).
Emission Behavior		Values are produced when collected.				Always has an active value.					Can be configured for buffering & replay.
Backpressure Handling	Supports buffer(), conflate().					Collects only the latest value.				Allows configuring buffering strategies.


Feature	                StateFlow	                                        SharedFlow

Type	                Hot stream (State Holder).	                        Hot stream (Event Broadcaster).
Initial Value	        Requires an initial value.	                        Does not require an initial value.
Value Retention	        Always holds the latest value.	                    Does not store the latest value unless replay is set.
Replay Behavior	        Only the latest value is available.	                Can be configured to replay past values (e.g., replay = 3).
Multiple Collectors	    All collectors receive the same latest value.	    Collectors receive values based on replay settings.
State or Event?	        Best for state (UI state, LiveData alternative).	Best for events (one-time UI events like Snackbar, Navigation).
Emission Behavior	    Updates value using value or emit().	            Emits values using emit(), supports buffering.
Concurrency Handling	Drops values if not collected immediately.	        Can buffer values if needed.
Use Case	            UI state management 	                            Event-driven communication (e.g., sending UI events, logging).
                        (e.g., text field updates, progress state).

HotFlow	                                                ColdFlow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hot flow emits data even when there is no collector.	Cold flow emits data when there is a collector.
Hot flow can store data.                                Cold flow does not store data.
Hot flow have multiple collectors(1 to N).              Cold flow can't have multiple collectors(1 flow for 1 collector).
