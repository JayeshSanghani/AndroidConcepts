
-> Launch mode
	-Launch mode defines how an activity should behave in the task stack.
	-Launch mode is specified using than android launch mode into menifest file.

	1) Standard (Default)
	2) Single Top
	3) Single Task
	4) Single Instance
	5) SingleInstancePerTask

1) Standard (Default)
	-This is the default launch mode of activity. If you don’t set any launch mode to your activity, it will use the standard mode by default. It creates a new instance of activity every time even if activity instance is already present.

	-Suppose we have A, B, C, and D activities and your activity B has standard launch mode. Now again launching activity B
	State of Activity Stack before launch B
	A →B→ C→D
	State of Activity Stack after launch B
	A → B → C→D→ B
	We can see that new instance of B is created again.

2) Single Top
	If an instance of activity already exists at the top of the current task, a new instance will not be created and the Android system will route the intent information through onNewIntent().
	If an instance is not present on top of the task then a new instance will be created.

	-Suppose we have A, B, C, and D activities. A →B →C →D

	-If we launch C then a new instance of C will be created as it is not on top.
	So it will look like A →B →C →D →C

	-Now suppose we have A →B →C →D →C like this
	then we if again launch C activity then in this case new instance will not be created. Instead, we will receive the callback on onNewIntent() method.

3) Single Task
	-In this launch mode, if the activity doesn't exist in the task, a new instance is created otherwise onNewIntent() is called. Additionally, activities above it get destroyed. 
	-The task with activities: A -> B -> C -> D
	Start activity E with launch mode single task: A -> B -> C -> D -> E
	Start activity B with launch mode single task: A -> B
	Now you can see that B is already there. So a new instance is not created. The onNewIntent() of B is called. 
	Also, C, D, and E which are above B were destroyed.


4) Single Instance
	-This mode is similar to singleTask mode, but the major difference is that the activity is launched in a new task and this task cannot have any other activities.
	--The task with activities: A -> B -> C -> D
	Launch E with launch mode single instance:
	Task-1: A -> B -> C -> D
	Task-2: E
	If you launch E again, it will not create a new task. In the same instance of E, the onNewIntent() method will be called.


5) SingleInstancePerTask
	-This mode is similar to singleInstance mode, but the only difference is that muliple instances of the activity can be created in different tasks.


Launch Mode		New Instance	Reuse Instance	Special Behavior
standard		Always			No				Default mode, always creates a new instance.
singleTop		No (if top)		Yes (if top)	Reuses instance if it's already at the top.
singleTask		No				Yes				Clears above stack, only one instance in app.
singleInstance	No				Yes				Separate task, no other activities in the same task.
singleInstance  No				Yes				Acts like singleInstance, but other activities can share the task.
PerTask
