-->What is Scope functions?
Scope functions in Kotlin are higher-order functions that allow you to execute a block of code within the context of an object.
They help in reducing boilerplate code and improving readability by allowing temporary modifications, transformations, or operations on an object.

-->Why Use Scope Functions?
Enhance Readability: Reduce redundant code by using a single scope function instead of repeatedly referencing an object.
Eliminate Null Checks: Handle nullable objects safely with let.
Modify Objects Concisely: apply helps configure objects inline.
Chain Operations Easily: run and let allow transforming and returning results within a single chain.
Perform Side Effects: also is useful for debugging or logging without modifying the object.

1️⃣ let
2️⃣ run
3️⃣ with
4️⃣ apply
5️⃣ also

1️⃣ let → When Working with Nullable Objects
✅ Use let when:
You need to safely access a nullable object.
You want to transform or modify the object.
You need to avoid NullPointerException without an explicit if check.
Example:
val isAdult = user.let {
    println("Checking if ${it.name} is an adult.")
    it.age >= 18
}
println("Is ${user.name} an adult? $isAdult")

2️⃣ run → When You Need a Result from an Object
✅ Use run when:
You need to initialize an object and return a computed value.
You want to group operations on an object and return a final result.
Example:
val userInfo = user.run {
    "Name: $name, Age: $age, Email: $email"
}
println("User Info: $userInfo")

3️⃣ with → When You Want to Perform Multiple Operations on an Object
✅ Use with when:
You want to group multiple operations on an object.
You don’t need to return the object itself but rather a result from the operations.
Example:
val description = with(user) {
  "User $name is $age years old and can be reached at $email."
}
println(description)

4️⃣ apply → When Configuring an Object
✅ Use apply when:
You need to modify or initialize an object’s properties.
You want to return the modified object itself.
Example:
val updatedUser = user.apply {
  age = 26
  email = "alice.new@example.com"
}
println("Updated User: $updatedUser")

5️⃣ also → When Performing Side Effects (Logging, Debugging)
✅ Use also when:
You need to perform additional actions without modifying the object.
You are logging, debugging, or validating an object.
Example:
val loggedUser = user.also {
  println("Logging user details: $it")
}

-->Combine Example

fun main() {
    val user = User("Alice", 25, "alice@example.com")

    // 1. let - Operates on the result of a lambda and returns its result
    val isAdult = user.let {
        println("Checking if ${it.name} is an adult.")
        it.age >= 18
    }
    println("Is ${user.name} an adult? $isAdult")

    // 2. run - Executes a block of code and returns its result
    val userInfo = user.run {
        "Name: $name, Age: $age, Email: $email"
    }
    println("User Info: $userInfo")

    // 3. with - Operates on an object within a block and returns a result
    val description = with(user) {
      "User $name is $age years old and can be reached at $email."
    }
    println(description)

    // 4. apply - Configures an object and returns the object itself
    val updatedUser = user.apply {
      age = 26
      email = "alice.new@example.com"
    }
    println("Updated User: $updatedUser")

    // 5. also - Performs additional operations on an object and returns the object itself
    val loggedUser = user.also {
      println("Logging user details: $it")
    }
}

🚀 Mastering Kotlin Scope Functions: Let, Run, With, Apply, Also 🔥

If you’re working with Kotlin, you’ve probably come across scope functions like let, run, with, apply, and also. These functions make code more readable, concise, and expressive, but choosing the right one can sometimes be confusing! 🤯

Here’s a quick breakdown to help you decide:
✅ let { } → Use when you need to modify or transform an object and return a result.
✅ run { } → Similar to let, but works better for scoping multiple operations.
✅ with(obj) { } → Best for performing multiple operations on the same object without modifying it.
✅ apply { } → Use when you want to configure an object and return the same instance.
✅ also { } → Ideal for side effects like logging or debugging, while returning the original object.
